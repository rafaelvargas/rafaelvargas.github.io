Hello, visitor! My name is **Rafael Vargas**. I specialize in designing and implementing systems that aim to facilitate the usage of data for analytical purposes, while also enabling the development of innovative features/tools for end users. Currently, I work as a Senior Analytics Engineer at [Nubank](https://international.nubank.com.br/about/) (the worldâ€™s largest digital banking platform outside of Asia).
