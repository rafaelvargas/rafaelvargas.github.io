Hello, visitor! My name is **Rafael Vargas**. Iâ€™m a professional who likes to work on the implementation of systems that use data, at large scale, for analytical purposes. Currently, I work as the leader of the Data Engineering team at [Nelogica](https://www.nelogica.com.br/) (a fintech that develops electronic trading platforms). 

I seek to work on challenging problems, which often require interaction with stakeholders, to generate viable technical solutions that meet business requirements. I strongly believe, as a Software Engineer/Leader, that the ability to intersect the business domain concepts with computer science concepts is essential to generate value.
